				<h1>Tone full analysis</h1>
				<p>
					The 3 main problems with their tone was being rude and impatient to
					each other, the meeting was very negative. If we had to mark them on
					Team Initiative & Engagement standards in the meeting I would give
					them uncooperative team. The whole meeting they were very rude to each
					other not wanting to work together but to work on their own and get it
					done faster but not working together causes the work to be done slower
					and when they do try to work together they just tell others what they
					did wrong and ask them why they did the work In that way “Jordan: “Why
					didn’t you use headings on your notes like we agreed?” this also makes
					the work go slower, they are just nit picking the work they already
					did. They all don’t agree with each other, and they don’t care about
					the other group mates they just care about them self leading to a very
					overall negative meeting slowing down the project. They have no
					planning whatsoever and they don’t communicate with each other always
					butting heads with each other during the meeting, and the overall
					teamwork is just nonexistent this is why we gave them the
					uncooperative team marking.
