							The 3 main problems for this group is the group being silent not
							talking, not wanting to work together, just going off on their own
							to do the work. The group being silent causes the conversation to
							be very awkward with no direction in how they are going to do the
							work. The main purpose is that everyone must work together if not
							people will overlap in their work and cause unnecessary conflict
							so them just going off and doing the work on their own makes it,
							so no one knows what they are doing. Everyone not talking can
							cause peoples good ideas to be looked over because they did not
							speak up about it.

							They never really thought about their audience they only thought
							about them self’s the whole meeting. They were also complaining
							about everyone in the group the whole time, they are also very
							rude to each other the whole meeting. Them not taking who they are
							talking to can cause a lot of unnecessary conflict and wasted time
							this is shown when Ahmed muted himself because he got too angry
							because of the conflict, “Both seemed really frustrated by this
							and they didn’t seem to interact much for a little while; Ahmed
							muted himself and seemed to have turned off his notifications. ”
							during the meeting there was a lot of complaining this caused the
							whole group to spilt apart and feel like they cant interact with
							each other. Being rude to your group mates can cause them to not
							want to help in the work and for them to not talk to you. Jordan
							posting a snapchat story calling his group is useless, makes the
							other groupmates not want to tell Jordan what’s going on and what
							the plan is for the project.

							Everyone seems to hate each other, only two of them have their
							video on and everyone has their mic on but are not talking, the
							main problem before the meeting was that there was no time to meet
							in person. In the meeting everyone is getting mad at each other
							because they don’t all agree on how this project should be done.
							This makes it so the work can’t get done or is done in a very
							problematic way causing unnecessary conflict. Only two people
							having their video on shows that no one else is ready for the
							meeting while everyone else seems less confident in their work,
							this causes them not to speak up for them self’s and the work they
							have done. Them having no time to work together on campus leads to
							them being unorganized, and it shows that they probably
							procrastinated on doing the work.

							The 3 main problems with their tone was being rude and impatient
							to each other, the meeting was very negative. If we had to mark
							them on Team Initiative & Engagement standards in the meeting I
							would give them uncooperative team. The whole meeting they were
							very rude to each other not wanting to work together but to work
							on their own and get it done faster but not working together
							causes the work to be done slower and when they do try to work
							together they just tell others what they did wrong and ask them
							why they did the work In that way “Jordan: “Why didn’t you use
							headings on your notes like we agreed?” this also makes the work
							go slower, they are just nit picking the work they already did.
							They all don’t agree with each other, and they don’t care about
							the other group mates they just care about them self leading to a
							very overall negative meeting slowing down the project. They have
							no planning whatsoever and they don’t communicate with each other
							always butting heads with each other during the meeting, and the
							overall teamwork is just nonexistent this is why we gave them the
							uncooperative team marking.
