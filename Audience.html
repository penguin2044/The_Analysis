				<h1>Audience full analysis</h1>
				<p>
					They never really thought about their audience they only thought about
					them self’s the whole meeting. They were also complaining about
					everyone in the group the whole time, they are also very rude to each
					other the whole meeting. Them not taking who they are talking to can
					cause a lot of unnecessary conflict and wasted time this is shown when
					Ahmed muted himself because he got too angry because of the conflict,
					“Both seemed really frustrated by this and they didn’t seem to
					interact much for a little while; Ahmed muted himself and seemed to
					have turned off his notifications. ” during the meeting there was a
					lot of complaining this caused the whole group to spilt apart and feel
					like they can't interact with each other. Being rude to your group
					mates can cause them to not want to help in the work and for them to
					not talk to you. Jordan posting a snapchat story calling his group
					useless, makes the other groupmates not want to tell Jordan what’s
					going on and what the plan is for the project.
