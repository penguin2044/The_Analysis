				<h1>Context full analysis</h1>
				<p>
					Everyone seems combative each other, only two of them have their video
					on and everyone has their mic on but are not talking, the main problem
					before the meeting was that there was no time to meet in person. In
					the meeting everyone is getting mad at each other because they don’t
					all agree on how this project should be done. This makes it so the
					work can’t get done or is done in a very problematic way causing
					unnecessary conflict. Only two people having their video on shows that
					no one else is ready for the meeting while everyone else seems less
					confident in their work, this causes them not to speak up for them
					self’s and the work they have done. Them having no time to work
					together on campus leads to them being unorganized, and it shows that
					they probably procrastinated on doing the work.
